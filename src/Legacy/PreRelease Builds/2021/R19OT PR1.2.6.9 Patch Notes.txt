Prerelease 1.2.6.9 is now available.

This update makes the following changes :

Fixed the robux icon on the play button not showing up.
Reverted the NotAPrice colors in /develop from a previous prerelease.
Item cards height is now set to auto.
Re-added the box shadow in the search bar (turns out 2019 did had one after all and I removed it in a previous prerelease for no reason lol)
Added back background and box shadow colors to active dropdown menus.
The theme now support the .touch class on all buttons I could apply to. (this means the theme is now close to being mobile friendly.)

This update makes the following changes :

Fixed fast search height when using btroblox from 57px to 44px, borders around the user icon when using fast search has been changed to match the theme.
Fixed where the play icon was using the bigger version when in dark mode.
Fixed where the vote counters aren't using the colored version in dark mode.
Emerged a few buttons and cleaned up the bottom area a bit.
Store cards no longer have border and are back to 150px in width.
Added borders to avatar plain cards.
In the main chat window if the conversation is unread the text is now darker to distinguish between read and unread messages.
Fixed avatar card buttons not having their proper background + dark mode version of this should be fixed.

Prerelease 1.2.6.2 is now available.

This update makes the following changes :

Replaced the headshot background colors.
Fixed a image position and size issue when a users icon was blocked / content deleted.
Fixed an issue where larger player counts on game cards would cause the position to overlap the title.
Reworked the css for the game carousel animation and the play button (it should now show up on other pages that use the css instead of the /games page)
The robux icon on the play button for games that cost robux is larger (unless I find out 2019 actually had a smaller version this will be permanently)

Prerelease 4.2.5.1 is here!
(This release is a bit small due to a recent roblox update)

This version includes the following changes :
Fixes to all the light theme buttons when your focusing on them
The upgrades payment method page now has the proper robux icon instead of the newer one, I also tried making it accurate to the 2019 version as best as I can
Fixed the search button after a recent roblox update broke the positioning
Reverted the footer update I had published a few releases ago (after I was proved wrong that the footer actually had the multilanguage options)

==Please Note==
That because of a recent roblox update that this version may be a bit buggy since I kinda rushed it

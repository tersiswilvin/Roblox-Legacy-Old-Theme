(So I realized 4 is a bit to high especially since I feel like I over did it so expect future releases to be version 1 instead of 4)
Prerelease 1.2.5.4 is here!

This version includes the following changes :

Chat header recommended game images should now be aligned properly.
Fixed an issue where the prices dropdown button appeared smaller and should now have its correct border radius.
Fixed a recent update when using btroblox where the header items would become mismatched to what they actually were.
Fixed some text not scaling properly when using a lower resolution + also replaced a few modern site icons with the colored ones.
Corrected text and hover coloring on a lot of the pages.

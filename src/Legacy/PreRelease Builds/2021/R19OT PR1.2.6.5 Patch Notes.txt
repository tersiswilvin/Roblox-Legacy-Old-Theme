Prerelease 1.2.6.5 is now available.

This update makes the following changes :

Fixed the message and friends icon when they were in focus.
Removed some unused CSS code from the theme.
Replaced some text colors still using the new variants.

(I wanted to apologize for the lack of much in this update the past day has been a bit rough after my account got terminated, I hope to speed up process on the theme again in the near future.)

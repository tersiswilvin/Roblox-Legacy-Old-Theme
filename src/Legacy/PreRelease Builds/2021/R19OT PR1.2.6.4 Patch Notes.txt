Prerelease 1.2.6.4 is now available.

This update makes the following changes :

The upgrade now button no longer relies on its ID for background and border colors when hovered and now relies on its secondary md class.
Fixed where some select option buttons would still be using 2021 background, border and text colors.
Made the disabled input selects in my settings more accurate.
Cleaned up and emerged some standalone buttons that were already in use.
Notification error banners have there correct background and text colors.
Vote mask segment heights are now 6px instead of 2px.
Secondary game card text colors now use #757575 instead of #191919.

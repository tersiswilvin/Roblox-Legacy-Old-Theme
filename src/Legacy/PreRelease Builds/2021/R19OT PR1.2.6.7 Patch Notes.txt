(December 12 2021)
Prerelease 1.2.6.7 is now available.

This update makes the following changes :

The left arrows on the /discovery page now has hover + redid how the right arrows work.
Avatar-group, avatar-group-card-plains and avatar-all now have their correct border and background colors.
Redid the 2 column status rows for profiles they should now exactly behave like it did in 2019.
Had to remove icon-error, icon-in-review, icon-blocked, icon-pending, icon-unknown icons due to them displaying incorrectly on some if not most places. (I may reintroduce these in a future release if I get them to show up correctly.)

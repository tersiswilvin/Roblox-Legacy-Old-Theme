(March 10 2022)
Prerelease 1.2.7.5 is available.

What's new :

Fixed where error page background was using the newer variant colors in dark theme.
Fixed where carousel controls would be off set on lower resolutions.
Fixed an issue where the game main content page in lower resolution would "break" due to a height issue.
Fixed the social media share borders displaying the dark theme border colors when in light theme.
Input field when focus no longer uses rgb values that set the background a bit transparent as well as the border.

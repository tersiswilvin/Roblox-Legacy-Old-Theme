(January 20 2022)
Prerelease 1.2.6.14 is available.

-| Apology on the 6 day delay I was busy doing other things. |-
What's new :

Dark mode buttons supports the .touch class. (let me know in bug-reports if you find any other buttons that I missed with the .touch class.)
Fixed some button classes being in the wrong place.
Reverted yet another Roblox change with the pager buttons in the inventory section.
Tweaked a few dark theme button colors + tweaked the old dark theme disabled pager to match the new design and match the light theme versions.

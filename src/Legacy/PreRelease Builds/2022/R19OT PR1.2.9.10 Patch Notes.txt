(May 04 2022)
Prerelease 1.2.9.10 is available.

What's new :

Added vote percentage support.
Restructured / redid how the buttons are (let me know in bug-reports if there's any buttons missing or displaying incorrectly).
Fixed adp having a white background.
Fixed store icons using the new border colors when using btroblox.
Fixed group overload text being #191919 instead of #f68802.
Fixed secondary lg buttons having a white background when you visited them.
Fixed the catalog stackable item cards height causing text / icons to be at the edge.
Redid the showsupervalue css on the robux page so it doesn't rely on :not().
Search bar in catalog and input dropdown buttons no longer has a gap caused by a recent Roblox change with margins.
Logged out users will now have no border in the footer like it was in 2019.

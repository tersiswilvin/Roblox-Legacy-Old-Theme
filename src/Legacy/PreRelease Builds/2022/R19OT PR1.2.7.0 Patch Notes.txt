Prerelease 1.2.7.0 is available.

( Navigation Update )
What's new :

Fixed a recent Roblox header change where in lower resolutions the navbar would be set to 82px causing the buttons to look out of place.
Theme supports hlist item background colors in dark theme.
Fixed where nav search icon in low resolutions was grey and now hovers blue instead of a lighter shade of grey.
Fixed an issue with the games and catalog text being misaligned in smaller resolutions.
Fixed an issue where the Roblox logo would be off centered a bit in help.roblox.com.
Heavily tried to revamp the item cards css so they no longer break in lower resolutions and use the 2019 css for them with small fixes put in place (let me know if this breaks in bug-reports and let me know what page as well).
Btn toggle flip background colors are now black when viewing it in dark theme.
Promoted article colors in help.roblox.com are now #191919 instead of rgb(57, 59, 61, 1).
help.roblox.com "hero" background image is now using the image from 2019.

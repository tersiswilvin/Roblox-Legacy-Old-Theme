(February 16 2022)
Prerelease 1.2.6.21 is available.

(Update 2/20/2022 : This update is broken due to me accidently copying the wrong copy template format for stylus  )
What's new :

Fixed where horizontal submenu borders were bright when using dark theme.
Theme now supports .xsmall classes.
Changed the avatar editor to be (hopefully) more accurate based on videos and screenshots from 2019. (I couldn't find any videos on avatar costumes other then a few only showing a glimpse of it in a video so this is sadly unchanged.)

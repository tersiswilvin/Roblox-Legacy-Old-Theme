(March 03 2022)
Prerelease 1.2.6.30.1 is available.

What's new :

Feature game cards are no longer huge, take up 2 rows and have a small label on the bottom to let you know that its featured for those that still want to know of course. (Yes im aware im late to this change but I also accidentally removed the old css for it off the theme prereleases ago, but will be kept unless otherwise.)

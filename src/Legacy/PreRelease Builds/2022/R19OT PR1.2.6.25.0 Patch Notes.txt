(February 20 2022)
Prerelease 1.2.6.25 is available.

(Small update)
What's new :

Theme now supports dark mode hat slots in avatar editor.
Fixed where a avatar card when disabled would still be using opacity .5 instead of 1 in dark theme.
Fixed where secondary md button text colors would return a darker color when the page was visited.

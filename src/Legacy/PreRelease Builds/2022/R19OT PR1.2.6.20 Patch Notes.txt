(February 14 2022)
Prerelease 1.2.6.20 is available.

What's new :

Fixed control md when on mobile would return the newer background / text colors
Changed the playtogether popup background color while using dark mode.
Changed the borders when using btroblox to match the theme in dark theme.
Changed asset background colors to black in dark mode to match theme.
Changed where the border in the server list on the games page wasn't matching in dark mode.
Btroblox blog text on the sidebar is now matching the theme in dark mode
Btroblox store card borders now match dark mode.
Fixed where the paired name in messages would return different nth-child colors in dark mode.
Footer text color has been re-added back to dark theme and now matches the theme.
Changed the section headers borders, gallery item background, and YouTube player labels to match in dark mode. (While these were untouched when light and dark mode were added I decided to change it so the light colors don't hurt your eyes when viewing it in dark mode.)

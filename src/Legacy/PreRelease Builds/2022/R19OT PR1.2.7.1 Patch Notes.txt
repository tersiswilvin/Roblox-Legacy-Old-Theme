Prerelease 1.2.7.1 is available.

( Btroblox Update )
What's new :

Changed the right navigation icons for messages and friends for btroblox where they didn't change the icon state on hover but show a background in btroblox.
Fixed a few btroblox borders still using the newer border colors or the old dark theme revamp border colors I forgot to change.
The settings panel for btroblox now has a black background then grey, and tried my best changing the checkmarks and buttons to match the theme in dark theme, it also now has its light box shadow so you can better see things.
Theme now supports btn generic back sm buttons as well as touch support.

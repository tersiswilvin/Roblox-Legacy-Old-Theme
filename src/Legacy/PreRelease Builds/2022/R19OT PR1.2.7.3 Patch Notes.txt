Prerelease 1.2.7.3 is available.

( Small Update )
What's new :

Fixed where the toggle description (or read more / show less) backgrounds wouldn't be consistent with the btroblox black flyouts I changed earlier.
Fixed where disabled btn toggle flips weren't effected and remained white in dark theme.
Fixed where btn toggle with [disabled] would not change the toggle flip background to the correct color in dark theme.
Fixed where item card containers on hover on lower resolutions would cause the width for btr item more to scale improperly.
Tweaked the box shadows for btr item more cards to somewhat better fit the other box shadows the theme uses.
Removed duplicate avatar card plain css.
Lowered the brightness for disabled btn toggles on background colors so it doesn't hurt your eyes viewing it in dark theme.

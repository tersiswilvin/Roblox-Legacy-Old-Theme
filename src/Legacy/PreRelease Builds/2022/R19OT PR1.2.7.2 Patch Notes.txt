Prerelease 1.2.7.2 is available.

( Small Update )
What's new :

Fixed an issue where Roblox popover containers might have had a transparent background or were in the wrong position.
Fixed where input fields on focus would return a semi transparent background and the border color was off
Fixed where the Roblox+ icon in the navigation sidebar wouldn't change in dark theme.
Decided to fix the rbx-tab-head classes so that they finally have padding again for extensions that still use that outdated class.

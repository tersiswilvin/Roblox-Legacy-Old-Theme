Prerelease 1.2.7.4 is available.

( Small Update )
What's new :

Added support for older play button themes these can be enabled in the theme (though you need to look for the ones fully disabled atm sorry) for optional multi year support.
Tried my best to revamping the login / signup buttons in the navbar when logged out so they're much accurate and support lower resolutions (let me know if this causes something to break in the navbar).
Removed duplicate item card thumbnail css + Brightened the item thumbnail cards a bit so you can see faces in dark theme.
Section contents now use its original padding (15px instead of 12px) the game main content now uses 12px for padding.

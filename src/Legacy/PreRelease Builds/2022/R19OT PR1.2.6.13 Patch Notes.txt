Prerelease 1.2.6.13 is available.

(Small Update)
What's new :

Corrected the extra large item title mark play icons height and width.
Reverted the profile about btn-generic buttons that roblox made.
Reverted another change roblox made where some warning text and warning images are greyscale. 
Reverted an update I made for grey robux icons, they are back to 28 x 28 instead of 12 x 12. (This should fix the issue on the robux page.)

(March 22 2022)
Prerelease 1.2.7.9.2 is available.

What's new :

Fixed position problems with some pages and the side navigation bar.
Fixed Roblox badge thumbnails being left centered.
Fixed profile slide containers using a white background instead of a transparent one.
Fixed an issue where right aligned items on the group page would break due to the last update.
Fixed where input group btn drop down menus would use padding when not suppose to.
Removed some old css code for the game cards for btroblox on profiles.
Moved asset thumbnail containers to a different location so it overlaps .border css (this is intentional to how 2019 did it).

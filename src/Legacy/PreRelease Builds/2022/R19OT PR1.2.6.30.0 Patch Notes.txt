Prerelease 1.2.6.30 is available.

What's new :

Fixed text labels using a newer variant color when on mobile.
Fixed where btn toggle was using dark theme colors in light theme.
Fixed item expire text colors being #191919 in light theme.
Fixed where asset thumb containers would override the .border css.
Fixed an issue with icon nav group icons in dark theme being orange (fully inverted) on the search page.
Fixed where the mobile card btn borders would use light theme border colors in dark theme while in a lower window (or monitor) resolution.
Fixed where add friend icons would be blue for light theme but grey for dark theme.
Theme now supports mobile panel background colors.
Theme now supports language backgrounds.
Theme now supports dark theme popovers.
Theme now better supports dark theme for the /create page.
Theme now supports dark theme modern modal border colors.
Added back the old studio icon in /create page.
Re-added back a small removed Roblox css feature where avatar card width in smaller resolution monitors / window would be set to 100%. (It looks like this was a thing in 2019 but was removed due to unknown reasons and due to its removal now causes the card text to clip through the border a bit depending of the users resolution and how long the persons username is lol)
Removed myfeeds css portion for some space back. (Unfortunately with the removal of myfeeds I had to remove this as it is no longer being used and is wasting space on the theme, every version from this point on will no longer use myfeeds unless Roblox revives it.)
Changed the behavior of the robux icon hover in the navigation header to better suit the new navbar update so it now changes the icon when your cursor changes to the pointer state instead of having to hover your cursor in the center for it to change.
